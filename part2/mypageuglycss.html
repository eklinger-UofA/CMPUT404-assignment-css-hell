                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p> I am a fifth year student at the university of alberta. I am currently
                enrolled in the computing science specialization program. I'l slated to
                graduate in April 2014 with my degree.</p>
                <p> Outside of schooling i am a 25 year old male who enjoys watching and
                playing sports. Also enjoy table top strategy games and board games. In my
                spare time i look for new open source projects for languages i've worked in
                and explore new areas on interest not covered in my schooling.</p>

                <h2>Professional History</h2>
                <p>Epcor: I worked on a team that was rolling Windows 7 into the workforce and
                transitioning all workstations and applications from Windows XP to Windows7.
                I dealt with application packaging, network deployment and any issues that
                came up while things were in the wild.</p>
                <p>EMC: I did a 12 month intership with EMC here in Edmonton. I got to work on a
                team that developed a training harness for their datacenter software and
                hardware. It was a greate challenge to work on such a large and complex system
                outside of the classroom atmosphere.</p>

                <h3>What Could I Offer?</h3>
                <p> I am just coming out of my degree and a successful internship with EMC as state above.
                Between my two pervious work experiences i've gained 2 years of work experience in
                the field and dealt with the pressures of working in a corporate environment.
                I have been working in object-oriented languages, dealing with good software practices 
                in work and through schooling project. I can bring energy, excitment and passion
                in the field on computing science to any work place i may be fortunate enough 
                to join.</p>
